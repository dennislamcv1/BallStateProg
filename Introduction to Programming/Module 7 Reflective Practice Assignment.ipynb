Once the list is full, use a list comprehension to create a new list where each item is half of what it used to be.  I.e. transform [4, 5, 6} to [2, 2.5, 3] \n",

    "Save this Jupyter Notebook, since you will submit it as part of this assignment. It is perfectly acceptable to describe trying to get something to work, and then failing to get it functioning as desired in the 20-30 min time block. This does not mean you'll get a bad grade for this assignment -- failing is a necessary part of learning, though none of us particularly enjoy it.  Sometimes what you'll try to accomplish is just too big of a task for a Reflective Practice session, and that is ok -- you will still have learned from the experience.
